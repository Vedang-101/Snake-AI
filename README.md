# Snakes in AI

This is part of my course project for the course of Machine Learning. In this project I decided to use my previous librabry for Neural Networks [Python ported version of Toy Neyral Network Librabry by Dan Shiffman]
Thus by using PyGame Library and the Neural Network Librabry the Snake AI is trained to dodge walls, avoid eating its own body and eat his snacks.
The neural network architecture for the snake is (8,15,9,4)

# Inputs
The snake requires 8 inputs for its working which are : wall to left, wall infront, wall right, angle to food, tail on left, tail on right, tail front, energy left
1-3 Inputs are boolean inputs ie.(1/0) based on if wall is to its left,infront or right respectively
